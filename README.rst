Audiogen
========

The ``audiogen`` package provides time domain audio processing tools
using Python generators.

This makes some types of audio sample generation and processing pretty
easy::

	# mix 440 Hz and 445 Hz tones to get 5 Hz beating
	beats = audiogen.mixer(
		(audiogen.tone(440), audiogen.tone(445)),
		[(constant(1), constant(1)),]
	)

The actual samples won't be generated or stored in memory until they're
actually consumed – for instance, when they're being written out to disk
in a wave \file::

    with open("output.wav", "wb") as f:
        audiogen.sampler.write_wav(f, beats)

Generators' at-consumption-time computation also allows creating
infinitely long output, e.g. to stream to speakers rather than a file on
disk::

    audiogen.sampler.write_wav(sys.stdout, audiogen.tone(440))

Or just::

    audiogen.sampler.play(audiogen.tone(440))

You can also use standard generator tools, e.g. the itertools module, to
handle audio data::

    beep_silence = itertools.chain(audiogen.beep(), audiogen.silence(0.5))
    infinite_beeps = itertools.cycle(beep_silence)

    audiogen.sampler.write_wav(sys.stdout, infinite_beeps)

Soundcard output
----------------

The easiest way to play directly to a soundcard output is to use the
``audiogen.sampler.play`` function, which will play your samples using
PyAudio::

    import audiogen
    import itertools
    import sys

    audiogen.sampler.play(
        itertools.cycle(itertools.chain(audiogen.beep(), audiogen.silence(0.5)))
    )

Alternatively, you could write your wave data to ``stdout``, e.g. ``myaudio.py``::

    import audiogen
    import itertools
    import sys

    audiogen.sampler.write_wav(
        sys.stdout,
        itertools.cycle(itertools.chain(audiogen.beep(), audiogen.silence(0.5)))
    )

Then pipe to a command line audio player like Sox_::

    python myaudio.py | play -t wav -

Installation
------------

Install with::

    $ pip install audiogen
    $ pip install --allow-external PyAudio --allow-unverified PyAudio PyAudio

PyAudio is optional. If it's not installed, playing audio via the soundcard with
``audiogen.sampler.play()`` will not be available, but generating Wave files –
including for piping to an external player, like ``sox`` – will work just fine.

Note that to install PyAudio on Mac OS X, you'll need to first install `portaudio`::

    $ brew install portaudio
